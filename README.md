# TLAB-ADHRMON

This is a TLAB from The Knowledge House 

Perform analysis on real heart-rate data. The company you work for, Seng-Links, aims to identify periods when a user sleeps or exercises using their varying recorded heart rates. 


Your company has provided you a data folder (*data/*) of 5 files that contain heart-rate samples from a participant. The participant's device records heart rate data every 5 minutes. This is the sampling rate, the interval at which heart rate data is recorded. Based on their personal data, you are tasked with writing code to determine when this participant is sleeping or exercising.


There are three Python files which you will modify in this repository to complete this project:
* cleaner.py
* metrics.py
* main.py
* writeup.md


The files with the prefix `test_` (i.e. `test_clean.py`, `test_metrics.py`, and `test_run.py`) 
**Do not modify the code in these files. Otherwise, you will not be able to check that your code is functioning correctly.**.
